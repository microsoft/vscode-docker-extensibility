# container-runtimes

## Overview
This package adds support for various container runtimes, abstracting away the details of the runtime and the way it is called, to provide a common interface.

## Usage
Each of the runtime clients provide a command line to execute and a function to parse the output, for each relevant operation. These items are combined into a `CommandResponse` object. In addition, many helpful utility classes are provided, for building command lines, running the commands, and a handful of other scenarios.

## Example
Here is an example for inspecting a container that uses the `ShellStreamCommandRunnerFactory` provided by this library:
```typescript
// Build the necessary objects
const dockerClient = new DockerClient();
const factory = new ShellStreamCommandRunnerFactory({
    // Many options are supported
});
const runCommand = factory.getCommandRunner();

// Get the command response, and run it in the shell command runner
const inspectionResults: InspectContainersItem[] | undefined = await runCommand(
    dockerClient.inspectContainers({ containers: ['myContainerName'] })
);

// Get the first item in the results
const result: InspectContainersItem | undefined = inspectionResults?.[0];

// If an item was found, output some information about it
if (result) {
    console.log(`${result.name} is running image ${result.imageName} (${result.imageId})`);
}
```

## Contributing
To add support for a container runtime, implement the `IContainersClient` interface. It is not strictly required that the implementation be in this package, but we do recommend it. Not all runtimes support all of the same concepts--in these cases, you can throw a `CommandNotSupportedError`.
